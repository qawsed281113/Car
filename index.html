          The Mercedes-Benz W222 is the sixth generation of the S-Class produced
          from 2013 to 2020, the successor of the W221 S-Class and the
          predecessor of the W223 S-Class. The W222 was designed during 2009.
          The original design proposal of the car was created by Il-hun Yoon, a
          Korean designer, who was inspired by the Mercedes-Benz F700 concept
          car. The exterior design was developed by a team of designers under
          the direction of Robert Lešnik. W222 has a similar design theme to the
          C-Class (W205) and E-Class (W213). In Europe, sales of the S 400
          Hybrid, S 350 BlueTEC, S 350 BlueTEC Hybrid, and S 500 began in
          September 2013. US sales of the S 550 also began in September; the
          4Matic four-wheel drive model went on sale in November, 2013.
          Additional models, including V12 models and those from AMG were
          released in 2014. The newest S-Class debuted on 15 May 2013 in
          Hamburg, Germany and entered production in Sindelfingen, Germany in
          June 2013. The production of W222 ends in September 2020 with the
          introduction of its successor, S-Class (W223), which made its world
          premiere on 2 September 2020 at the brand-new Factory 56 in
          Sindelfingen.In 1972, Mercedes-Benz introduced the W116 line, the
          first to be officially called the S-Class.[3] Produced from 1972
          through 1980, the W116 series featured a four-wheel independent
          suspension and disc brakes. The 280, 350, and 450 (4.5L version)
          models featured SE and SEL versions. Production of the W116 totaled
          473,035 units. This was a groundbreaking sedan for Mercedes-Benz, and
          for the first time in the company history, the car had an obvious,
          blatant and outward emphasis on safety placed above a pure styling
          viewpoint. The overall design incorporated numerous safety features
          developed from the "safety research vehicles" in the mid-to-late 1960s
          to the very early 1970s. These safety features were all newly
          introduced passenger-car "firsts" on a production vehicle: padded door
          trim around the windows, heavily padded steering wheel (later to be
          replaced by an airbag with the Mercedes-Benz abbreviation of SRS
          standing for the English-language term Supplemental Restraint System),
          more comprehensive safety padding on the dashboard and around the
          interior, dual asymmetric windshield wipers, headrests with a center
          depression to locate the occupant's head in a more central position
          during a rear impact, a rain-water management system to improve
          visibility consisting of deep channels on both sides of the windshield
          and flowing into deeply channeled rain gutters, including similar
          designs on the side mirrors, rounded body shapes along the edges, such
          as the tops of the front fenders, etc., designed to ameliorate
          pedestrian injuries, ribbed rear taillamp lenses which would remain
          clearer of dirt on the recessed areas, an easy-to-access first aid kit
          stowed in a recessed compartment on the rear parcel shelf prominently
          labeled with the universally recognized "cross" symbol which
          represents "first aid", and several other subtle safety features
          related to both active and passive safety. The Mercedes Benz S-Class
          is a classic chauffeur driven car,[4] and has frequently been used as
          standard by car hire companies. It is comfortable and safe as well as
          elegant looking; ideal for drives across the countryside or high class
          transport on a night out. The W116 models were large luxury sedans.
          The W116 was larger on the outside than the W108/W109 series it
          replaced, but had similar interior capacity, as the additional bulk
          was driven by several new and aforementioned engineering developments
          on car safety and occupant protection in a crash. The W116 introduced
          other improved passive safety features into the vehicle design,
          including a strengthened vehicle occupant shell. It was one of the
          first cars to be available with ABS, a driver's airbag supplemental
          restraint system (but not available at the vehicle's initial launch).
          Also, the W116 was the first mass production passenger vehicle offered
          with a turbocharged diesel engine. The 450SE, then the most powerful
          model in the W116 lineup, was awarded European Car of the Year in
          1974. At the New England Auto Show in 1972 held in the fall season in
          Boston, the Monroney Label of a 1973 450SE was right at $13,000. 1973
          was the first model year of the W116 for the US market. Starting in
          1975, the W116 was upgraded with a new fuel injection system to comply
          with revised exhaust emission standards in European markets. A slight
          power reduction was a result of this update, but in 1978, a series of
          further engine upgrades restored original performance levels under the
          new fuel injection systems. Between 1973 and 1977, 997 Special Edition
          W116 models were made on order by Mercedes. These cars incorporated
          stronger body paneling and suspension and was 50 kg heavier than its
          normal counterpart.

          The Audi A8 is a full-size luxury sedan manufactured and marketed by
          the German automaker Audi since 1994. Succeeding the Audi V8, and now
          in its fourth generation, the A8 has been offered with both front- or
          permanent all-wheel drive—and in short- and long-wheelbase variants.
          The first two generations employed the Volkswagen Group D platform,
          with the current generation deriving from the MLB platform. After the
          original model's 1994 release, Audi released the second generation in
          late 2002, the third in late 2009, and the fourth and current
          iteration in 2017. Noted as the first mass-market car with an
          aluminium chassis, all A8 models have used this construction method
          co-developed with Alcoa and marketed as the Audi Space Frame.[2] A
          mechanically upgraded, high-performance version of the A8 debuted in
          1996 as the Audi S8. Produced exclusively at Audi's Neckarsulm plant,
          the S8 is fitted standard with Audi's quattro all-wheel drive system,
          and is available in short- and long-wheelbase form.Audi introduced the
          S8 4.2 quattro into the European market in 1996. The S8 followed the
          naming convention of other high-performance Audi "S" models such as
          the Audi A6-derived S6 and was similar in vein of Mercedes-Benz AMG
          models. In some markets such as the UK, the S8 was only available with
          the automatic transmission. Cosmetically, Audi differentiated the S8
          from the A8 with solid aluminium alloy door mirror housings,
          chrome-effect beltline and lower front grille trim, and polished twin
          exhaust pipes, along with subtle "S8" badging. 14-way power adjustable
          and heated sports front seats with memory function were fitted as were
          heated rear seats. Standard alloy wheels were 18-inch cast aluminium
          alloy "Avus" six-spoke style. After the 1999 facelift, 20-inch
          polished nine-spoke RS wheels became an option. In 2002, 18-inch
          nine-spoke RS wheels became a no-cost option. At the same time of the
          A8's facelift in late 1999, the S8 received the same cosmetic
          upgrades. This update marked the release of the S8 to the North
          American market. Production of the D2 series S8 ended in September
          2002. The D2 series S8 featured an uprated, 250 kW (335 hp) version of
          the 4.2-litre V8 with four valves per cylinder. From late 1999, Audi
          increased this to five valves per cylinder with power increased to 265
          kilowatts (355 hp) and 430 newton-metres (317 lb⋅ft). From launch in
          1996, European-market models came standard with a six-speed manual
          transmission. A sports-recalibrated version of the ZF 5HP24 five-speed
          tiptronic automatic, featuring "Dynamic Shift Programme" (DSP) was
          released a year later and was the only transmission available in most
          other markets. A retuned, 20-millimetre (0.8 in) lowered sports
          suspension included a 30 percent stiffer spring rate and 40 percent
          more compression damping in the shock absorbers. Speed-sensitive
          "servotronic" power assisted steering was also standard. The brakes
          featured Bosch 5.3 anti-lock braking system (ABS), with electronic
          brakeforce distribution (EBD), and worked radially ventilated front
          discs. From 2002, an upgraded Bosch 5.7 electronic stability programme
          became standard fitment.
